# Simple Shopping List

Simple Shopping List is a small [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application to show how to use [Action Cable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) and the [Stimulus JavaScript framework](https://stimulusjs.org/).

## Setup

To set up and start the Rails server for development, run the `bin/setup` script to install the application's dependencies.

The application doesn't require a database to run. The shopping list data is persisted through the browser's [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
